## Questions
# How do we make sure the input only contains integers and can only contain 5 characters? When should we clear out the input or should we?
# What endpoint are we using from the API? Are there query parameters to send over? Where do I put the API Key?
# What happens when we enter new information for the second time? 
# When I click the button does it always automatically hide the bottom pane?
# HTML/CSS
# Conditional rendering
# When you first load page, the only thing you see is the input and the button
# After submission of a zip code you will see the rest.

# Protecting the input

 ## Objectives
# Single div for the whole application
# document.createElement 
# document.appendChild
# Use zip code input to fetch data from Open Weather Map API
# Axios / onClick or onSubmit
# Handle successful or unsuccessful attempts to the API
# If the request is successful, display the following in a 'mobile app' format:
# City name
# Current weather conditions
# Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius
# A unique image, decided by the current temperature (The API has icons built-in, be sure to read the docs)
# If the request is unsuccessful, display a specific error message such as "Invalid Zip Code" or anything else that might come back from the API.
# Handle multiple attempts to enter a zip code
# Look good on desktop and mobile using Bootstrap
